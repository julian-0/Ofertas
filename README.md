# Ofertas

[Spanish Readme](https://github.com/julian-0/Ofertas/blob/master/README_ES.md)

This project is the practical work of the UTN-FRBA data management subject.
This practical work simulates the implementation of a new system that allows the implementation of offers and coupons, including invoicing.

The implementation of this system previously required the migration of the denormalized data that were available, in order to have a standardized database that allows compliance with the new restrictions.

### The functionalities of this system are:
* Login
* Menú
* Buy offers
* Publish offers
* View stadistics
* CRUD of:
  * Clients
  * Suppliers
  * Roles

## Used technologies:
* SQL Server 2012
* Microsoft Visual C# 2012

## Entity–relationship model
